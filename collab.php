                            <p class="para mb-3" style="text-align:justify;">At Shristi International Society, we believe that real impact is
                                achieved through strong partnerships and collaborative efforts. Over the years, we have
                                had the privilege of working alongside like-minded organizations, government
                                departments, and community leaders who share our vision for a better, more inclusive
                                society.</p>

                            <p class="para mb-3" style="text-align:justify;">We have collaborated with various government bodies and institutions to
                                implement programs that address health, education, environment, and cultural
                                preservation. Notably, our association with the Department of Cultural Affairs,
                                Government of Assam, enabled us to successfully organize music and cultural events
                                celebrating the legacy of Bharat Ratna Dr. Bhupen Hazarika.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-2">Corporate & Health Sector Collaborations</h4>
                            <p class="para mb-3" style="text-align:justify;">Our health-focused initiatives have received support from esteemed
                                institutions such as the Guwahati Oil Refinery, which partnered with us for our
                                inaugural free health check-up camp in 2013. These partnerships help us extend
                                professional services like medical care, diagnostics, and medicine distribution to
                                underserved communities.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-2">Community-Based Collaborations</h4>
                            <p class="para mb-3" style="text-align:justify;">We work closely with local schools, NGOs, and community leaders to
                                organize events such as:</p>
